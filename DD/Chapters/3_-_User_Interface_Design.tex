In this section, an overview of the user interface of the S\&C system is presented.
The focus is primarily on the user experience, with secondary attention given to the user interface. Although the interface has been carefully designed, it remains subject to refinement based on feedback from usability testing and focus groups.
The mock-ups shown below include both the desktop browser version and the mobile application version, allowing us to showcase the interface for both Student and Company users. The desktop version provides full access to all functionalities, while the mobile version, designed to be fully responsive, ensures a seamless experience across devices regardless of screen size or user type.

\section{General overview}
The image below illustrates the structure of the pages accessible within the S\&C application.
All pages are accessible only after logging into the main login page, which serves as a gateway separating Student, Company and University dashboards.

\end{figure}

As previously mentioned, the login section is the entry point for users, allowing them, upon successful authentication, to access their respective dashboards and interact with the system’s features. In S\&C, there are three primary types of dashboards corresponding to the three main user roles involved in the system’s processes: Students, Companies and Universities.

While the dashboards slightly in their aesthetic choices (such as color schemes), they maintain a consistent structure and layout. This design decision was made to optimize development by relying on reusable components, ensuring a scalable and maintainable interface that can be efficiently updated over time.

From the Company dashboard, the following pages can be accessed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Company Profile Management – For updating and managing company information
    \item Post a New Internship and Manage Existing Internships – To create internship opportunities and oversee the ones already posted.
    \item View Applications and Contact Students – To review applications submitted by students and/or initiate communication with potential candidates.
    \item Submit a Complaint for Active Internships – A page dedicated to reporting issues related to ongoing internships. 
    \item Submit Feedback for Terminated Internships – A page for providing feedback on completed internships.
\end{itemize}

From the Student dashboard, the following pages can be accessed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Student Profile Management – To update personal details, academic information, and preferences.
    \item Internship Search and Application – To browse available internships and submit applications.
    \item Submit a Complaint for Active Internships – To report issues or challenges encountered during an ongoing internship.
    \item Submit Feedback for Terminated Internships – To provide feedback about completed internship experiences.
\end{itemize}

From the University dashboard, the following page can be accessed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complaint Management – To review and handle complaints submitted by students enrolled at the university regarding their ongoing internships.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, both dashboards provide users with targeted notifications relevant to their role. All the pages outlined above will be described in greater detail in the following sections. \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Registration Interface}
The registration interface is designed to allow users, whether students or companies, to create an account on the S\&C platform. The mockup showcases a simple and intuitive form where users are required to input their email address and choose a secure password, which must be confirmed by re-entering it. To proceed, users must also agree to the platform’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy by selecting the appropriate checkboxes.

Once the form is submitted, the system sends a confirmation email to the address provided by the user. This email contains a unique link that, when clicked, activates the user’s account. \\
